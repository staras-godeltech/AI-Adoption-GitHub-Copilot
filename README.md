# Cosmetology Booking App - AI-Powered Development Project

## 📋 Overview
A full-stack web application for cosmetology service booking, built as a demonstration of AI-assisted development using GitHub Copilot. The application enables customers to browse services, view availability, and book appointments, while cosmetologists can manage and moderate all bookings.

### Core Features
- **Customer-facing interface**: Browse services, view available time slots, book appointments
- **Cosmetologist dashboard**: View all bookings, approve/reject appointments, manage schedule
- **User authentication**: Separate flows for customers and cosmetologists
- **Responsive design**: Mobile-friendly UI built with React

## 🤖 AI Development Approach

### Development Philosophy
This project serves as a learning exercise for AI-assisted development. The goal is to have **90%+ of code generated by AI tools**, with the developer acting primarily as a reviewer and orchestrator.

### Prompt Strategy
1. **Architecture first**: Get AI to propose overall structure
2. **Component by component**: Build incrementally with clear prompts
3. **Test-driven**: Generate tests alongside implementation
4. **Iterative refinement**: Use follow-up prompts to improve generated code

## 📝 Prompt Log (To Be Filled During Development)
